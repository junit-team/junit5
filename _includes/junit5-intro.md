## About

*JUnit 5* is the next generation of JUnit.
The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

JUnit 5 is the result of [JUnit Lambda](http://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda.html) and its [crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo](http://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda-campaign.html).

The JUnit 5 team released [Milestone 6](docs/current/user-guide/#release-notes-5.0.0-m6) on July 18, 2017, and is currently working on a release candidate, and ultimately a GA release (see [Roadmap](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/wiki/Roadmap) for details).

## About

*JUnit 5* is the current generation of the JUnit testing framework, which provides a modern foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

JUnit 5 began as the result of the [JUnit Lambda](https://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda.html) project and its [crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo](https://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda-campaign.html).

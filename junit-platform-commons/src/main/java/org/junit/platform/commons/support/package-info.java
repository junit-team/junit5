/**
 * Maintained common support API provided by the JUnit Platform.
 *
 * <p>The purpose of this package is to provide {@code TestEngine} and
 * {@code Extension} authors convenient access to a subset of internal utility
 * methods helping with their implementation. This prevents re-inventing the
 * wheel and ensures that common tasks are handled in the same way as within
 * the JUnit Platform.

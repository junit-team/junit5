/**
 * The {@code Launcher} API is the main entry point for client code that
 * wishes to <em>discover</em> and <em>execute</em> tests using one or more
 * {@linkplain org.junit.platform.engine.TestEngine test engines}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are responsible for determining
 * the set of test engines to delegate to at runtime and for ensuring that
 * each test engine has an
 * {@linkplain org.junit.platform.engine.TestEngine#getId ID} that is unique
 * among the registered test engines. For example, the default implementation
 * returned by {@link org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherFactory#create}
 * dynamically discovers test engines via Java's {@link java.util.ServiceLoader
 * ServiceLoader} mechanism.
 *
 * <p>Test discovery and execution require a {@link LauncherDiscoveryRequest}
 * that is passed to all registered engines. Each engine decides which tests it
 * can discover and execute according to the supplied request.
 *
 * <p>Prior to executing tests, clients of this interface should
 * {@linkplain #registerTestExecutionListeners register} one or more
 * {@link TestExecutionListener} instances in order to get feedback about the
 * progress and results of test execution. Listeners will be notified of events
 * in the order in which they were registered.  The default implementation
 * returned by {@link org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherFactory#create}
 * dynamically discovers test execution listeners via Java's
 * {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader} mechanism.

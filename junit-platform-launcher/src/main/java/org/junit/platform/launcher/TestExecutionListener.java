/**
 * Register a concrete implementation of this interface with a {@link Launcher}
 * to be notified of events that occur during test execution.
 *
 * <p>All methods in this interface have empty <em>default</em> implementations.
 * Concrete implementations may therefore override one or more of these methods
 * to be notified of the selected events.
 *
 * <p>All {@code TestExecutionListener} methods are called sequentially. Methods
 * for start events are called in registration order while methods for finish
 * events are called in reverse order. Test case execution won't start before
 * all {@link #executionStarted(TestIdentifier)} calls have returned.
 *
 * <p>If an exception is thrown by an implementation of a method of this
 * interface, the exception will be caught and logged unless it is deemed
 * {@linkplain UnrecoverableExceptions unrecoverable}. In consequence, a
 * {@code TestExecutionListener} cannot cause test execution to fail or abort it
 * early by throwing an exception.
 *
 * <p>JUnit provides two example implementations.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.junit.platform.launcher.listeners.LoggingListener}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.junit.platform.launcher.listeners.SummaryGeneratingListener}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Contrary to JUnit 4, {@linkplain org.junit.platform.engine.TestEngine test engines}
 * are supposed to report events not only for {@linkplain TestIdentifier identifiers}
 * that represent executable leaves in the {@linkplain TestPlan test plan} but also
 * for all intermediate containers. However, while both the JUnit Vintage and JUnit
 * Jupiter engines comply with this contract, there is no way to guarantee this for
 * third-party engines.
 *
 * <p>As of JUnit Platform 1.8, a {@code TestExecutionListener} can access
 * {@linkplain org.junit.platform.engine.ConfigurationParameters configuration
 * parameters} via the {@link TestPlan#getConfigurationParameters()
 * getConfigurationParameters()} method in the {@code TestPlan} supplied to
 * {@link #testPlanExecutionStarted(TestPlan)} and
 * {@link #testPlanExecutionFinished(TestPlan)}.
 *
 * <p>Note on concurrency: {@link #testPlanExecutionStarted(TestPlan)} and
 * {@link #testPlanExecutionFinished(TestPlan)} are always called from the same
 * thread. It is safe to assume that there is at most one {@code TestPlan}
 * instance at a time. All other methods could be called from different threads
 * concurrently in case one or multiple test engines execute tests in parallel.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @see Launcher
 * @see TestPlan
 * @see TestIdentifier

=== Overall Improvements

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-overall-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Minimum required Java version is now 17.
* Minimum required Kotlin version is now 2.2.
* Platform, Jupiter, and Vintage artifacts now use the same version number.

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-overall-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* All JUnit modules now use https://jspecify.dev/[JSpecify]'s nullability annotations to
  indicate which method parameters, return types, etc. can be `null`.


[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-platform-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Remove deprecated support for running the `ConsoleLauncher` without specifying a
  subcommand.
* Remove support for deprecated non-conventional `ConsoleLauncher` options such as
  `--h` (rather than `-h`) or `-help` (rather than `--help`).
* The `junit-platform-runner` module that provided the JUnit 4 based `JUnitPlatform`
  runner has been discontinued.
* The `junit-platform-jfr` module that provided custom Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events
  for test discovery and execution has been discontinued. Instead, the functionality is
  now available directly in `junit-platform-launcher` without requiring an additional
  dependency.
* Support for Maven Surefire/Failsafe versions less than 3.0.0 has been dropped.
* The following deprecated APIs have been removed:
  - `ReflectionSupport.loadClass(String)` method
  - `ReflectionUtils.readFieldValue(...)` methods
  - `ReflectionUtils.getMethod(...)` method
  - `BlacklistedExceptions` class
  - `PreconditionViolationException` class (from `org.junit.platform.commons.util`)
  - `ClasspathScanningSupport` class
  - `ConfigurationParameters.size()` method
  - `MethodSelector.getMethodParameterTypes()` method
  - `NestedMethodSelector.getMethodParameterTypes()` method
  - `ReportEntry()` constructor
  - `SingleTestExecutor` class
  - `LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder()` constructor
  - `LegacyReportingUtils` class
  - `TestPlan.add(TestIdentifier)`, `TestPlan.getChildren(String)`, and
    `TestPlan.getTestIdentifier(String)` methods
  - `TestPlan.add(TestIdentifier)` and `TestPlan.getChildren(String)` methods
  - `@UseTechnicalNames` annotation
  - `EngineTestKit.execute(String, EngineDiscoveryRequest)`,
    `EngineTestKit.execute(TestEngine, EngineDiscoveryRequest)`, and
    `EngineTestKit.Builder.filters(...)` methods
* Support for "legacy semantics" for field and method searches that used to be
  configurable via the `junit.platform.reflection.search.useLegacySemantics` system
  property has been removed. JUnit now always adheres to standard Java semantics regarding
  whether a given field or method is visible or overridden according to the rules of the
  Java language.
* The type bounds of the following methods have been changed to be more flexible and allow
  nullable and non-nullable types:
  - `ConfigurationParameters.get(String, Function)`
  - `NamespacedHierarchicalStore.getOrComputeIfAbsent(N, K, Function)`
  - `NamespacedHierarchicalStore.getOrComputeIfAbsent(N, K, Function, Class)`


[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-jupiter-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The following deprecated APIs have been removed:
  - `MethodOrderer.Alphanumeric` class
  - `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation, ExtensionContext)` method
* The deprecated `junit.jupiter.tempdir.scope` configuration parameter is no longer
  supported.
* The `JRE` enum constants for `JAVA_8` to `JAVA_16` have been deprecated because they can
  no longer be used at runtime since `JAVA_17` is the new baseline. Please also manually
  update any values used with the `minVersion` and `maxVersion` attributes in
  `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` or the `versions` attributes in
  `@EnabledOnJre` and `@DisabledOnJre` to ensure that you are no longer declaring version
  values less than 17.
* `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` now use `JAVA_17` as their default
  `min` value.
* The contracts for the `Executable` parameters of Kotlin-specific `assertTimeout`
  functions were changed from `callsInPlace(executable, EXACTLY_ONCE)` to
  `callsInPlace(executable, AT_MOST_ONCE)` which might result in compilation errors.
* As a result of migrating from
  https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers[univocity-parsers] to
  https://fastcsv.org/[FastCSV] for `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`, root causes and
  messages of exceptions thrown for malformed CSV input may differ in some cases. While
  the overall parsing behavior remains consistent, this may affect custom error handling
  that relies on specific exception types or messages.
* The `lineSeparator` attribute in `@CsvFileSource` has been removed. The line separator
  is now automatically detected, meaning that any of `\r`, `\n`, or `\r\n` is treated as a
  line separator.
* Attributes such as `ignoreLeadingAndTrailingWhitespace`, `nullValues`, and others in
  `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` now apply to header fields as well as to regular
  fields.
* The `junit-jupiter-migrationsupport` artifact and its contained classes are now
  deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.
* The type bounds of the following methods have been changed to be more flexible and allow
  nullable and non-nullable types:
  - `ExtensionContext.getConfigurationParameter(String, Function)`
  - `ExtensionContext.getOrComputeIfAbsent(K, Function)`
  - `ExtensionContext.getOrComputeIfAbsent(K, Function, Class)`

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-jupiter-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* Kotlin's `suspend` modifier may now be applied to test and lifecycle methods.
* The `Arguments` interface for parameterized tests is now officially a
  `@FunctionalInterface`.
* The implementation of `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` has been migrated from the no
  longer maintained https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers[univocity-parsers] to
  https://fastcsv.org/[FastCSV]. This improves the consistency of CSV input handling,
  including for malformed entries, and provides better error reporting and overall
  performance.


[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M1-junit-vintage-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The JUnit Vintage engine is now deprecated and will report an INFO level discovery issue
  when it finds at least one JUnit 4 test class. For now, the intent of the deprecation is
  not to signal removal in the next major version but to clarify the intended purpose of
  the engine. It should only be used temporarily while migrating tests to JUnit Jupiter or
  another testing framework with native JUnit Platform support.

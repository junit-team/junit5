[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* `@RegisterExtension` fields that are `null` when evaluated are no longer silently
  ignored. Instead, the corresponding test class or test method now fails with an
  informative exception.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* Extensions registered _programmatically_ via `@RegisterExtension` may now be registered
  in an explicit order via the `@Order` annotation.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-programmatic-order, Extension
    Registration Order>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `@NullSource`, `@EmptySource`, and `@NullAndEmptySource` argument sources that
  provide `null` and _empty_ arguments to `@ParameterizedTest` methods.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-null-and-empty,
    Null and Empty Sources>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `TestWatcher` extension API that allows extensions to process test results by
  defining result-based callbacks invoked after text execution.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* The `VintageTestEngine` now uses the fully qualified class name as the _legacy reporting
  name_ for Vintage test classes instead of the simple class name which caused problems in
  test reports based on legacy reporting names -- for example, reports generated by Maven
  Surefire.

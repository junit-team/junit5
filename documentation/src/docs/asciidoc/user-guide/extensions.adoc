[[extensions]]
== Extension Model

[[extensions-overview]]
=== Overview

In contrast to the competing `Runner`, `@Rule`, and `@ClassRule` extension points in
JUnit 4, the JUnit Jupiter extension model consists of a single, coherent concept: the
`Extension` API. Note, however, that `Extension` itself is just a marker interface.

[[extensions-registration]]
=== Registering Extensions

Extensions can be registered _declaratively_ via
<<extensions-registration-declarative,`@ExtendWith`>>, _programmatically_ via
<<extensions-registration-programmatic,`@RegisterExtension`>>, or _automatically_ via
Java's <<extensions-registration-automatic,`ServiceLoader`>> mechanism.

[[extensions-registration-declarative]]
==== Declarative Extension Registration

Developers can register one or more extensions _declaratively_ by annotating a test
interface, test class, test method, or custom _<<writing-tests-meta-annotations,composed
annotation>>_ with `@ExtendWith(...)` and supplying class references for the extensions
to register.

For example, to register a custom `MockitoExtension` for a particular test method, you
would annotate the test method as follows.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
@Test
void mockTest() {
	// ...
}
----

To register a custom `MockitoExtension` for all tests in a particular class and its
subclasses, you would annotate the test class as follows.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MockTests {
	// ...
}
----

Multiple extensions can be registered together like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ExtendWith({ FooExtension.class, BarExtension.class })
class MyTestsV1 {
	// ...
}
----

As an alternative, multiple extensions can be registered separately like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ExtendWith(FooExtension.class)
@ExtendWith(BarExtension.class)
class MyTestsV2 {
	// ...
}
----

.Extension Registration Order
NOTE: Extensions registered declaratively via `@ExtendWith` will be executed in the order
in which they are declared in the source code. For example, the execution of tests in
both `MyTestsV1` and `MyTestsV2` will be extended by the `FooExtension` and
`BarExtension`, **in exactly that order**.

[[extensions-registration-programmatic]]
==== Programmatic Extension Registration

Developers can register extensions _programmatically_ by annotating fields in test
classes with `{RegisterExtension}`.

When an extension is registered _declaratively_ via
<<extensions-registration-declarative,`@ExtendWith`>>, it can typically only be
configured via annotations. In contrast, when an extension is registered via
`@RegisterExtension`, it can be configured _programmatically_ – for example, in order to
pass arguments to the extension's constructor, a static factory method, or a builder API.

NOTE: `@RegisterExtension` fields must not be `private` or `null` (at evaluation time)
but may be either `static` or non-static.

[[extensions-registration-programmatic-static-fields]]
===== Static Fields

If a `@RegisterExtension` field is `static`, the extension will be registered after
extensions that are registered at the class level via `@ExtendWith`. Such _static
extensions_ are not limited in which extension APIs they can implement. Extensions
registered via static fields may therefore implement class-level and instance-level
extension APIs such as `BeforeAllCallback`, `AfterAllCallback`, and
`TestInstancePostProcessor` as well as method-level extension APIs such as
`BeforeEachCallback`, etc.

In the following example, the `server` field in the test class is initialized
programmatically by using a builder pattern supported by the `WebServerExtension`. The
configured `WebServerExtension` will be automatically registered as an extension at the
class level – for example, in order to start the server before all tests in the class and
then stop the server after all tests in the class have completed. In addition, static
lifecycle methods annotated with `@BeforeAll` or `@AfterAll` as well as `@BeforeEach`,
`@AfterEach`, and `@Test` methods can access the instance of the extension via the
`server` field if necessary.

[source,java,indent=0]
.An extension registered via a static field

include::{testDir}/example/registration/WebServerDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

[[extensions-registration-programmatic-instance-fields]]
===== Instance Fields

If a `@RegisterExtension` field is non-static (i.e., an instance field), the extension
will be registered after the test class has been instantiated and after each registered
`TestInstancePostProcessor` has been given a chance to post-process the test instance
(potentially injecting the instance of the extension to be used into the annotated
field). Thus, if such an _instance extension_ implements class-level or instance-level
extension APIs such as `BeforeAllCallback`, `AfterAllCallback`, or
`TestInstancePostProcessor`, those APIs will not be honored. By default, an instance
extension will be registered _after_ extensions that are registered at the method level
via `@ExtendWith`; however, if the test class is configured with
`@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)` semantics, an instance extension will be registered
_before_ extensions that are registered at the method level via `@ExtendWith`.

In the following example, the `docs` field in the test class is initialized
programmatically by invoking a custom `lookUpDocsDir()` method and supplying the result
to the static `forPath()` factory method in the `DocumentationExtension`. The configured
`DocumentationExtension` will be automatically registered as an extension at the method
level. In addition, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, and `@Test` methods can access the
instance of the extension via the `docs` field if necessary.

[[extensions-registration-automatic]]
==== Automatic Extension Registration

In addition to <<extensions-registration-declarative,declarative extension registration>>
and <<extensions-registration-programmatic,programmatic extension registration>> support
using annotations, JUnit Jupiter also supports _global extension registration_ via Java's
`java.util.ServiceLoader` mechanism, allowing third-party extensions to be auto-detected
and automatically registered based on what is available in the classpath.

Specifically, a custom extension can be registered by supplying its fully qualified class
name in a file named `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.Extension` within the
`/META-INF/services` folder in its enclosing JAR file.

[[extensions-registration-automatic-enabling]]
===== Enabling Automatic Extension Detection

Auto-detection is an advanced feature and is therefore not enabled by default. To enable
it, simply set the `junit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled` _configuration
parameter_ to `true`. This can be supplied as a JVM system property, as a _configuration
parameter_ in the `LauncherDiscoveryRequest` that is passed to the `Launcher`, or via the
JUnit Platform configuration file (see <<running-tests-config-params>> for details).

For example, to enable auto-detection of extensions, you can start your JVM with the
following system property.

`-Djunit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled=true`

When auto-detection is enabled, extensions discovered via the `ServiceLoader` mechanism
will be added to the extension registry after JUnit Jupiter's global extensions (e.g.,
support for `TestInfo`, `TestReporter`, etc.).

[[extensions-registration-inheritance]]
==== Extension Inheritance

Registered extensions are inherited within test class hierarchies with top-down
semantics. Similarly, extensions registered at the class-level are inherited at the
method-level. Furthermore, a specific extension implementation can only be registered
once for a given extension context and its parent contexts. Consequently, any attempt to
register a duplicate extension implementation will be ignored.

[[extensions-conditions]]
=== Conditional Test Execution

`{ExecutionCondition}` defines the `Extension` API for programmatic, _conditional test
execution_.

An `ExecutionCondition` is _evaluated_ for each container (e.g., a test class) to
determine if all the tests it contains should be executed based on the supplied
`ExtensionContext`. Similarly, an `ExecutionCondition` is _evaluated_ for each test to
determine if a given test method should be executed based on the supplied
`ExtensionContext`.

When multiple `ExecutionCondition` extensions are registered, a container or test is
disabled as soon as one of the conditions returns _disabled_. Thus, there is no guarantee
that a condition is evaluated because another extension might have already caused a
container or test to be disabled. In other words, the evaluation works like the
short-circuiting boolean OR operator.

See the source code of `{DisabledCondition}` and `{Disabled}` for concrete examples.

[[extensions-conditions-deactivation]]
==== Deactivating Conditions

Sometimes it can be useful to run a test suite _without_ certain conditions being active.
For example, you may wish to run tests even if they are annotated with `@Disabled` in
order to see if they are still _broken_. To do this, simply provide a pattern for the
`junit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate` _configuration parameter_ to specify which
conditions should be deactivated (i.e., not evaluated) for the current test run. The
pattern can be supplied as a JVM system property, as a _configuration parameter_ in the
`LauncherDiscoveryRequest` that is passed to the `Launcher`, or via the JUnit Platform
configuration file (see <<running-tests-config-params>> for details).

For example, to deactivate JUnit's `@Disabled` condition, you can start your JVM with the
following system property.

`-Djunit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate=org.junit.*DisabledCondition`

[[extensions-conditions-deactivation-patterns]]
===== Pattern Matching Syntax

If the `junit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate` pattern consists solely of an asterisk
(`+*+`), all conditions will be deactivated. Otherwise, the pattern will be used to match
against the fully qualified class name (_FQCN_) of each registered condition. Any dot
(`.`) in the pattern will match against a dot (`.`) or a dollar sign (`$`) in the FQCN.
Any asterisk (`+*+`) will match against one or more characters in the FQCN. All other
characters in the pattern will be matched one-to-one against the FQCN.

Examples:

- `+*+`: deactivates all conditions.
- `+org.junit.*+`: deactivates every condition under the `org.junit` base package and any
  of its subpackages.
- `+*.MyCondition+`: deactivates every condition whose simple class name is exactly
  `MyCondition`.
- `+*System*+`: deactivates every condition whose simple class name contains `System`.
- `org.example.MyCondition`: deactivates the condition whose FQCN is exactly
  `org.example.MyCondition`.

[[extensions-test-instance-post-processing]]
=== Test Instance Post-processing

`{TestInstancePostProcessor}` defines the API for `Extensions` that wish to _post
process_ test instances.

Common use cases include injecting dependencies into the test instance, invoking custom
initialization methods on the test instance, etc.

For concrete examples, consult the source code for the `{MockitoExtension}` and the
`{SpringExtension}`.

[[extensions-parameter-resolution]]
=== Parameter Resolution

`{ParameterResolver}` defines the `Extension` API for dynamically resolving parameters at
runtime.

If a test constructor or a `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`,
`@TestFactory`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll` method accepts
a parameter, the parameter must be _resolved_ at runtime by a `ParameterResolver`. A
`ParameterResolver` can either be built-in (see `{TestInfoParameterResolver}`) or
<<extensions-registration,registered by the user>>. Generally speaking, parameters may be
resolved by _name_, _type_, _annotation_, or any combination thereof. For concrete
examples, consult the source code for `{CustomTypeParameterResolver}` and
`{CustomAnnotationParameterResolver}`.

[WARNING]
====
Due to a bug in the byte code generated by `javac` on JDK versions prior to JDK 9,
looking up annotations on parameters directly via the core `java.lang.reflect.Parameter`
API will always fail for _inner class_ constructors (e.g., a constructor in a `@Nested`
test class).

The `{ParameterContext}` API supplied to `ParameterResolver` implementations therefore
includes the following convenience methods for correctly looking up annotations on
parameters. Extension authors are strongly encouraged to use these methods instead of
those provided in `java.lang.reflect.Parameter` in order to avoid this bug in the JDK.

* `boolean isAnnotated(Class<? extends Annotation> annotationType)`
* `Optional<A> findAnnotation(Class<A> annotationType)`
* `List<A> findRepeatableAnnotations(Class<A> annotationType)`
====

[[extensions-lifecycle-callbacks]]
=== Test Lifecycle Callbacks

The following interfaces define the APIs for extending tests at various points in the
test execution lifecycle. Consult the following sections for examples and the Javadoc for
each of these interfaces in the `{extension-api-package}` package for further details.

* `{BeforeAllCallback}`
** `{BeforeEachCallback}`
*** `{BeforeTestExecutionCallback}`
*** `{AfterTestExecutionCallback}`
** `{AfterEachCallback}`
* `{AfterAllCallback}`

.Implementing Multiple Extension APIs
NOTE: Extension developers may choose to implement any number of these interfaces
within a single extension. Consult the source code of the `{SpringExtension}` for a
concrete example.

[[extensions-lifecycle-callbacks-before-after-execution]]
==== Before and After Test Execution Callbacks

`{BeforeTestExecutionCallback}` and `{AfterTestExecutionCallback}` define the APIs for
`Extensions` that wish to add behavior that will be executed _immediately before_ and
_immediately after_ a test method is executed, respectively. As such, these callbacks are
well suited for timing, tracing, and similar use cases. If you need to implement
callbacks that are invoked _around_ `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` methods, implement
`BeforeEachCallback` and `AfterEachCallback` instead.

The following example shows how to use these callbacks to calculate and log the execution
time of a test method. `TimingExtension` implements both `BeforeTestExecutionCallback`
and `AfterTestExecutionCallback` in order to time and log the test execution.

[[extensions-lifecycle-callbacks-timing-extension]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.An extension that times and logs the execution of test methods
----
include::{testDir}/example/timing/TimingExtension.java[tags=user_guide]
----

Since the `TimingExtensionTests` class registers the `TimingExtension` via `@ExtendWith`,
its tests will have this timing applied when they execute.

[source,java,indent=0]
.A test class that uses the example TimingExtension
----
include::{testDir}/example/timing/TimingExtensionTests.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The following is an example of the logging produced when `TimingExtensionTests` is run.

....
INFO: Method [sleep20ms] took 24 ms.
INFO: Method [sleep50ms] took 53 ms.
....

[[extensions-exception-handling]]
=== Exception Handling

`{TestExecutionExceptionHandler}` defines the API for `Extensions` that wish to handle
exceptions thrown during test execution.

The following example shows an extension which will swallow all instances of `IOException`
but rethrow any other type of exception.

[source,java,indent=0]
.An exception handling extension
----
include::{testDir}/example/exception/IgnoreIOExceptionExtension.java[tags=user_guide]
----

[[extensions-test-templates]]
=== Providing Invocation Contexts for Test Templates

A `{TestTemplate}` method can only be executed when at least one
`{TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider}` is registered. Each such provider is responsible
for providing a `Stream` of `{TestTemplateInvocationContext}` instances. Each context may
specify a custom display name and a list of additional extensions that will only be used
for the next invocation of the `{TestTemplate}` method.

The following example shows how to write a test template as well as how to register and
implement a `{TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider}`.

[source,java,indent=0]
.A test template with accompanying extension
----
include::{testDir}/example/TestTemplateDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

In this example, the test template will be invoked twice. The display names of the
invocations will be "`foo`" and "`bar`" as specified by the invocation context. Each
invocation registers a custom `{ParameterResolver}` which is used to resolve the method
parameter. The output when using the `ConsoleLauncher` is as follows.

....
└─ testTemplate(String) ✔
   ├─ foo ✔
   └─ bar ✔
....

The `{TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider}` extension API is primarily intended for
implementing different kinds of tests that rely on repetitive invocation of a test-like
method albeit in different contexts — for example, with different parameters, by preparing
the test class instance differently, or multiple times without modifying the context.
Please refer to the implementations of <<writing-tests-repeated-tests>> or
<<writing-tests-parameterized-tests>> which use this extension point to provide their
functionality.


[[extensions-keeping-state]]
=== Keeping State in Extensions

Usually, an extension is instantiated only once. So the question becomes relevant: How do
you keep the state from one invocation of an extension to the next? The
`ExtensionContext` API provides a `Store` exactly for this purpose. Extensions may put
values into a store for later retrieval. See the
`<<extensions-lifecycle-callbacks-timing-extension, TimingExtension>>` for an example of
using the `Store` with a method-level scope. It is important to remember that values
stored in an `ExtensionContext` during test execution will not be available in the
surrounding `ExtensionContext`. Since `ExtensionContexts` may be nested, the scope of
inner contexts may also be limited. Consult the corresponding JavaDoc for details on the
methods available for storing and retrieving values via the `{ExtensionContext_Store}`.

.`ExtensionContext.Store.CloseableResource`
NOTE: An extension context store is bound to its extension context lifecycle. When an
extension context lifecycle ends it closes its associated store. All stored values
that are instances of `CloseableResource` are notified by
an invocation of their `close()` method.

[[extensions-supported-utilities]]
=== Supported Utilities in Extensions

The `junit-platform-commons` artifact exposes a package named
`{junit-platform-support-package}` that contains _maintained_ utility methods for working
with annotations, classes, reflection, and classpath scanning tasks. `TestEngine` and
`Extension` authors are encouraged to use these supported methods in order to align with
the behavior of the JUnit Platform.

[[extensions-supported-utilities-annotations]]
==== Annotation Support

`AnnotationSupport` provides static utility methods that operate on annotated elements
(e.g., packages, annotations, classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields).
These include methods to check whether an element is annotated or meta-annotated with a
particular annotation, to search for specific annotations, and to find annotated methods
and fields in a class or interface. Some of these methods search on implemented
interfaces and within class hierarchies to find annotations. Consult the JavaDoc for
`{AnnotationSupport}` for further details.

[[extensions-supported-utilities-classes]]
==== Class Support

`ClassSupport` provides static utility methods for working with classes (i.e., instances
of `java.lang.Class`). Consult the JavaDoc for `{ClassSupport}` for further details.

[[extensions-supported-utilities-reflection]]
==== Reflection Support

`ReflectionSupport` provides static utility methods that augment the standard JDK
reflection and class-loading mechanisms. These include methods to scan the classpath in
search of classes matching specified predicates, to load and create new instances of a
class, and to find and invoke methods. Some of these methods traverse class hierarchies
to locate matching methods. Consult the JavaDoc for `{ReflectionSupport}` for further
details.

[[extensions-execution-order]]
=== Relative Execution Order of User Code and Extensions

When executing a test class that contains one or more test methods, a number of extension
callbacks are called in addition to the user-provided test and lifecycle methods. The
following diagram illustrates the relative order of user-provided code and extension code.

:figure-caption: User code and extension code

[#extensions-execution-order-diagram,reftext='{figure-caption}']
image::extensions_lifecycle.png[caption='',title='{figure-caption}']

User-provided test and lifecycle methods are shown in orange, with callback code provided
by extensions shown in blue. The grey box denotes the execution of a single test method
and will be repeated for every test method in the test class.

The following table further explains the twelve steps in the
<<extensions-execution-order-diagram>> diagram.

[cols="5,15,80"]
|===
| Step | Interface/Annotation | Description

| 1
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.BeforeAllCallback`
| extension code executed before all tests of the container are executed

| 2
| annotation `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll`
| user code executed before all tests of the container are executed

| 3
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.BeforeEachCallback`
| extension code executed before each test is executed

| 4
| annotation `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`
| user code executed before each test is executed

| 5
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.BeforeTestExecutionCallback`
| extension code executed immediately before a test is executed

| 6
| annotation `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`
| user code of the actual test method

| 7
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.TestExecutionExceptionHandler`
| extension code for handling exceptions thrown during a test

| 8
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.AfterTestExecutionCallback`
| extension code executed immediately after test execution and its corresponding exception handlers

| 9
| annotation `org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach`
| user code executed after each test is executed

| 10
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.AfterEachCallback`
| extension code executed after each test is executed

| 11
| annotation `org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll`
| user code executed after all tests of the container are executed

| 12
| interface `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.AfterAllCallback`
| extension code executed after all tests of the container are executed

|===

In the simplest case only the actual test method will be executed (step 6); all other
steps are optional depending on the presence of user code or extension support for the
corresponding lifecycle callback. For further details on the various lifecycle callbacks
please consult the respective JavaDoc for each annotation and extension.

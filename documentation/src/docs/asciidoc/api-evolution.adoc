== API Evolution

One of the major goals of JUnit 5 is to improve maintainers' capabilities to evolve JUnit
despite its being used in many projects. With JUnit 4 a lot of stuff that was originally
added as an internal construct only got used by external extension writers and tool
builders. That made changing JUnit 4 especially difficult and sometimes impossible.

That's why JUnit 5 introduces a defined lifecycle for all publicly available interfaces,
classes, and methods.

=== API Annotations

All publicly available interfaces, classes, and methods are annotated with {API}. The
annotation's `Usage` value can be assigned one of the following five values:

[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Usage            | Description

| `Internal`       | Must not be used by any code other than JUnit itself. Might be removed without prior notice.
| `Deprecated`     | Should no longer be used; might disappear in the next minor release.
| `Experimental`   | Intended for new, experimental features where we are looking for feedback. +
                     Use this element with caution; it might be promoted to `Maintained` or
                     `Stable` in the future, but might also be removed without prior notice, even in a patch.
| `Maintained`     | Intended for features that will not be changed in a backwards-
                     incompatible way for *at least* the next minor release of the current
                     major version. If scheduled for removal, it will be demoted to `Deprecated` first.
| `Stable`         | Intended for features that will not be changed in a backwards-
                     incompatible way in the current major version (`5.*`).
|===

If the `@API` annotation is present on a type, it is considered to be applicable for all
public members of that type as well. A member is allowed to declare a different `Usage`
value of lower stability.

=== Semantic Versioning

JUnit 5 version numbers are used in a semantic way: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

=== Tooling Support

The JUnit team plans to provide native tooling support for all JUnit 5 users, extenders,
and tool builders. The tooling support will provide a means to check if the JUnit 5 APIs
are being used in accordance with `@API` annotation declarations.

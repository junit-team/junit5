[[release-notes-5.0.0-m5-junit-platform]]
==== JUnit Platform

===== Bug Fixes

* A `NullPointerException` thrown by `ConsoleLauncher` in `Details.TREE` mode was fixed
  by falling back to printing throwable's `toString()` representation.
* `DefaultLauncher` now catches and warns about exceptions generated by an engine in its
  discovery and execution phases. Other engines are processed normally.

===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The deprecated `--hide-details` option of the `ConsoleLauncher` has been removed; use
  `--details none` instead.

===== New Features and Improvements

* When a `TestEngine` is discovered via Java's `ServiceLoader` mechanism, an attempt
  will now be made to determine the location from which the engine class was loaded,
  and if the location URL is available, it will be logged at configuration-level.


[[release-notes-5.0.0-m5-junit-jupiter]]
==== JUnit Jupiter

===== Bug Fixes

* ❓

===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* In order to ensure the _composability_ of all supported extension APIs in JUnit
  Jupiter, several methods in existing APIs have been renamed.
** See <<release-notes-5.0.0-m5-migration-extension-api>> for details.
* The `arguments()` method in the `ArgumentsProvider` API in the `junit-jupiter-params`
  module has been renamed to `provideArguments()`.
* The `create()` factory method in `ObjectArrayArguments` in the `junit-jupiter-params`
  module has been renamed to `arguments()`.

[[release-notes-5.0.0-m5-junit-vintage]]
==== JUnit Vintage

===== Bug Fixes

* The `VintageTestEngine` no longer filters out test classes declared as static member
  classes, since they are valid JUnit 4 test classes.
* The `VintageTestEngine` no longer attempts to execute abstract classes as test classes.
  Instead, a warning is now logged stating that such classes are excluded.

/**
 * {@code @BeforeEach} is used to signal that the annotated method should be
 * executed <em>before</em> <strong>each</strong> {@code @Test},
 * {@code @RepeatedTest}, {@code @ParameterizedTest}, {@code @TestFactory},
 * and {@code @TestTemplate} method in the current test class.
 *
 * <h2>Method Signatures</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeEach} methods must have a {@code void} return type and must
 * not be {@code static}. Using {@code private} visibility is strongly
 * discouraged and will be disallowed in a future release.
 * They may optionally declare parameters to be resolved by
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolver ParameterResolvers}.
 *
 * <h2>Inheritance and Execution Order</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeEach} methods are inherited from superclasses as long as they
 * are not <em>overridden</em> or <em>superseded</em> (i.e., replaced based on
 * signature only, irrespective of Java's visibility rules). Furthermore,
 * {@code @BeforeEach} methods from superclasses will be executed before
 * {@code @BeforeEach} methods in subclasses.
 *
 * <p>Similarly, {@code @BeforeEach} methods declared as <em>interface default
 * methods</em> are inherited as long as they are not overridden, and
 * {@code @BeforeEach} default methods will be executed before {@code @BeforeEach}
 * methods in the class that implements the interface.
 *
 * <p>JUnit Jupiter does not guarantee the execution order of multiple
 * {@code @BeforeEach} methods that are declared within a single test class or
 * test interface. While it may at times appear that these methods are invoked
 * in alphabetical order, they are in fact sorted using an algorithm that is
 * deterministic but intentionally non-obvious.
 *
 * <p>In addition, {@code @BeforeEach} methods are in no way linked to
 * {@code @AfterEach} methods. Consequently, there are no guarantees with regard
 * to their <em>wrapping</em> behavior. For example, given two
 * {@code @BeforeEach} methods {@code createA()} and {@code createB()} as well
 * as two {@code @AfterEach} methods {@code destroyA()} and {@code destroyB()},
 * the order in which the {@code @BeforeEach} methods are executed (e.g.
 * {@code createA()} before {@code createB()}) does not imply any order for the
 * seemingly corresponding {@code @AfterEach} methods. In other words,
 * {@code destroyA()} might be called before <em>or</em> after
 * {@code destroyB()}. The JUnit Team therefore recommends that developers
 * declare at most one {@code @BeforeEach} method and at most one
 * {@code @AfterEach} method per test class or test interface unless there are
 * no dependencies between the {@code @BeforeEach} methods or between the
 * {@code @AfterEach} methods.
 *
 * <h2>Composition</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeEach} may be used as a meta-annotation in order to create
 * a custom <em>composed annotation</em> that inherits the semantics of
 * {@code @BeforeEach}.

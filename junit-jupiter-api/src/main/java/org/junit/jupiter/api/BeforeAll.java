/**
 * {@code @BeforeAll} is used to signal that the annotated method should be
 * executed <em>before</em> <strong>all</strong> tests in the current test class.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to {@link BeforeEach @BeforeEach} methods, {@code @BeforeAll}
 * methods are only executed once for a given test class.
 *
 * <h2>Method Signatures</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeAll} methods must have a {@code void} return type and must
 * be {@code static} by default. Consequently, {@code @BeforeAll} methods are
 * not supported in {@link Nested @Nested} test classes or as <em>interface
 * default methods</em> unless the test class is annotated with
 * {@link TestInstance @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)}.
 * However, beginning with Java 16 {@code @BeforeAll} methods may be declared as
 * {@code static} in {@link Nested @Nested} test classes, and the
 * {@code Lifecycle.PER_CLASS} restriction no longer applies. {@code @BeforeAll}
 * methods may optionally declare parameters to be resolved by
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolver ParameterResolvers}.
 *
 * <p>Using {@code private} visibility for {@code @BeforeAll} methods is
 * strongly discouraged and will be disallowed in a future release.
 *
 * <h2>Inheritance and Execution Order</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeAll} methods are inherited from superclasses as long as
 * they are not <em>hidden</em> (default mode with {@code static} modifier),
 * <em>overridden</em>, or <em>superseded</em> (i.e., replaced based on
 * signature only, irrespective of Java's visibility rules). Furthermore,
 * {@code @BeforeAll} methods from superclasses will be executed before
 * {@code @BeforeAll} methods in subclasses.
 *
 * <p>Similarly, {@code @BeforeAll} methods declared in an interface are
 * inherited as long as they are not <em>hidden</em> or <em>overridden</em>,
 * and {@code @BeforeAll} methods from an interface will be executed before
 * {@code @BeforeAll} methods in the class that implements the interface.
 *
 * <p>JUnit Jupiter does not guarantee the execution order of multiple
 * {@code @BeforeAll} methods that are declared within a single test class or
 * test interface. While it may at times appear that these methods are invoked
 * in alphabetical order, they are in fact sorted using an algorithm that is
 * deterministic but intentionally non-obvious.
 *
 * <p>In addition, {@code @BeforeAll} methods are in no way linked to
 * {@code @AfterAll} methods. Consequently, there are no guarantees with regard
 * to their <em>wrapping</em> behavior. For example, given two
 * {@code @BeforeAll} methods {@code createA()} and {@code createB()} as well as
 * two {@code @AfterAll} methods {@code destroyA()} and {@code destroyB()}, the
 * order in which the {@code @BeforeAll} methods are executed (e.g.
 * {@code createA()} before {@code createB()}) does not imply any order for the
 * seemingly corresponding {@code @AfterAll} methods. In other words,
 * {@code destroyA()} might be called before <em>or</em> after
 * {@code destroyB()}. The JUnit Team therefore recommends that developers
 * declare at most one {@code @BeforeAll} method and at most one
 * {@code @AfterAll} method per test class or test interface unless there are no
 * dependencies between the {@code @BeforeAll} methods or between the
 * {@code @AfterAll} methods.
 *
 * <h2>Composition</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeAll} may be used as a meta-annotation in order to create
 * a custom <em>composed annotation</em> that inherits the semantics of
 * {@code @BeforeAll}.
